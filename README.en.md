# ZhuaTech Return Merchandise Authorization

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for retail, commerce, product, and after-sales operations.

ZhuaTech Return Merchandise Authorization provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for retail, commerce, product, and after-sales operations. It is designed for store teams, commerce operators, product teams, and service managers, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise return merchandise authorization, self-hosted return merchandise authorization, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Store teams, commerce operators, product teams, and service managers.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Tenant Guard** — Manage tenant guard with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **User** — Coordinate user through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Auth Session** — Track auth session metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Business Record** — Preserve business record evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Audit Event** — Expose audit event in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Idempotency Record** — Connect idempotency record to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Architecture and Runtime

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `scripts/` — repeatable local validation and maintenance scripts
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.demo.example up -d --build
```
